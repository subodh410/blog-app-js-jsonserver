Winter is coming, and we need to start getting ready ASAP, no excuses.To get prepared, we dug through the internet and rounded up gloves that are not only cozy but stylish, too.

Children age 13 and over can have their own Apple ID. For younger children, you can create and manage an Apple ID for them. To get started with Family Sharing, open Settings on an iPhone or iPad, tap your Apple ID name, then choose Family Sharing and Set Up Your Family. If you're on a Mac, open up System Preferences, then choose Family Sharing. Follow the instructions to invite people to your family or set up the necessary Apple IDs for your youngsters.With your family created, services such as Apple TV Plus, Apple Music, Apple News Plus, and Apple Arcade are shared automatically if you've subscribed to them. Any iCloud storage you've purchased is pooled between family members, and Photos automatically creates a shared album for everyone to use. Most of this happens without any effort on your part—when people in your family sign into their Apple account, they'll see the same apps and services available as you do.",

In this guest post, writer Ethan Jakob Craft shares his tips and advice to help you road trip the region on a budget.Tucked away in Canada’s northwestern corner is the Yukon Territory, a veritable paradise home to just 35,000 people and endless top-notch wilderness. The Yukon is dominated by thick boreal forest in the south and treeless tundra in the north and dotted with rugged peaks and lakeside beaches in between.I first visited the territory at age 7 as a half-day shore excursion on an Alaskan cruise (yes, the border really is that close), and didn’t know what to make of it.
